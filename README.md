# Goodcheck - Regexp based customizable linter

Are you reviewing a pull request if the change contains deprecated API calls?
Do you want to post a comment to ask the developer if a method call satisfies some condition for use without causing an issue?
What if a misspelling like `Github` for `GitHub` can be found automatically?

Give Goodcheck a try to do them instead of you! ðŸŽ‰

Goodcheck is a customizable linter. You can define pairs of patterns and messages.
It checks your program and when it detects a piece of text matching with the defined patterns, it prints your message which tells your teammates why it should be revised and how.
Some part of the code reviewing process can be automated.
With Goodcheck the only thing you have to do is define the rules, pairing patterns with messages, and then those same patterns wonâ€™t bother you anymore. ðŸ˜†

## Getting started

Goodcheck is provided as a Ruby gem. To install it, run:

```console
$ gem install goodcheck
```

If you do not want to install it, you can run it via Docker instead:

```console
$ docker run -t --rm -v "$(pwd):/work" sider/goodcheck
```
